# Discord Bot Example
A simple example Discord bot that can read a string on Discord and return a string.
Once a command has been issued, print 

# .env
A dotenv (`.env`) file is required to make this work with the following parameters:
`DISCORD_TOKEN=[[TOKEN HERE]]`
`DISCORD_SERVER=[[SERVER NAME HERE]]`
Further environment variables can be provided and passed in.

# Libraries used
Python default libraries: `os`
To run this locally, you'll need to install the following: `discord` and `python-dotenv`.
`pip install -U discord python-dotenv`
